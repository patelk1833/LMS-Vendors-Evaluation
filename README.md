## Project Overview
The LMS Vendor Evaluation Project was undertaken to analyze whether Wentworth Institute of Technology (WIT) should renew its contract with Brightspace or transition to a new Learning Management System (LMS). The evaluation addressed stakeholder requirements, vendor options, cost-benefit analysis, and operational priorities to ensure alignment with WIT’s academic and strategic goals.

## Key Objectives
- Assess stakeholder needs, including faculty, students, and administrators.  
- Evaluate alternative LMS platforms: Brightspace, Canvas, Moodle, and Blackboard Ultra.  
- Conduct cost analysis and determine Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).  
- Recommend the most efficient, cost-effective, and user-friendly LMS solution.  

## Methodology
1. **Case Analysis:** Reviewed the previous transition from Blackboard to Brightspace in 2020, identifying implementation challenges and lessons learned.  
2. **Requirements Gathering:** Conducted interviews, surveys, and focus groups with key stakeholders (faculty, students, Digital Technology Services, and deans) to identify critical needs and concerns.
3. **Vendor Vetting:** Researched eight LMS options, narrowing down to four finalists: Brightspace, Canvas, Moodle, and Blackboard Ultra.
4. **Decision Scorecard:** Created weighted evaluation criteria (e.g., usability, integration, scalability, cost) to objectively compare vendor options.
5. **Cost Analysis:** Developed a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for each LMS, including license fees, implementation, maintenance, and training.  

## Findings
- **Canvas:** Superior user experience but highest TCO.  
- **Brightspace:** Strong integration with existing systems and cost-effective.  
- **Moodle:** Lowest cost but high technical requirements and outdated interface.  
- **Blackboard Ultra:** Robust grading tools but higher costs and less intuitive navigation.  

## Recommendations
- Retain Brightspace as WIT’s LMS of choice due to the following:  
  - Transition costs and logistical challenges outweigh the benefits of switching to Canvas.  
  - Brightspace’s existing familiarity and integration minimize disruption for faculty and students.  
  - Focus on improvements to Brightspace, particularly the grading system, through targeted contract negotiations.  
- Extend Brightspace’s contract for five years to ensure stability while implementing refinements.

## Conclusion
This project exemplifies my ability to analyze complex systems, engage stakeholders, and provide actionable recommendations for decision-making processes in technology acquisition.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Effective collaboration with diverse user groups.  
- **Data Analysis:** Conducted cost-benefit analysis and scoring evaluations.  
- **Technical Research:** Researched and compared multiple LMS platforms.
